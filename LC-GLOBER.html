Past work solves this problem by employing a video auto-encoder to represent videos with low-dimension video features, and empowering its video decoder with generative capability to compensate for information loss. However, the synthesized video frames suffer from sub-optimal local consistency due to unaligned information among frame-wise features and severe generation stochasticity. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a novel approach, named LC-GLOBER. First, we introduce two information streams to align frame features from both the content and temporal perspectives. Then, multi-level coarse-to-fine constraints are introduced to truncate the sampling space to reduce stochasticity. Moreover, based on the insight that the similarity of two video frames tends to decay when the frame distances increase, we propose a novel auto-regressive noise decomposition method to retain the temporal correlations among video frames. This method retains the frame correlations throughout the generation process, thus further enhancing video consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. In particular, we achieved a significant overall improvement in five challenging benchmarks compared to prior methods. </p>
